# stoic-dashboard
A simple dashboard for productivity, with a Stoic flavor.

## Technologies used
React, Redux, Sequelize, Postgres...everything in package.json.

## Issues & To-Dos
* [ ] Update models - capture more info
* [ ] Increased functionality in components
* [ ] Sequelize issue with dates *(I don't think this is actually a concern; looks like they're stored in the DB as UTC but come out in local time)*
* [ ] d3 visualizations - get off of npm packages and build these yourself
* [ ] Add users & authentication
* [ ] Add favicon (this is annoying with Webpack)
* [ ] Build as a React Native mobile app
* [ ] API integration - post to social media; pull in workouts from Strava, commits from Github, etc.
* [ ] Payment? Could charge monthly for this

## Contribute
* Absolutely, create an issue or submit a pull request.
